<h6>Need Based Leave (NBL)</h6>
<ol>

<li>Need Based Leave is a concept designed in line with our company philosophy i.e. every employee must be responsible enough to decide on the need / importance / urgency of any leave â€“ and the decision should not be driven by seeing the balance in the leave card.</li>

<li>	<span  class="lv_highlight">No accumulation or carry forward is allowed in case of NBL.</span></li>

The application has to be forwarded by the employee to their Vertical Leader for approval.

The approved leave application has to be submitted to the HR team for recordings and subsequent processing.

<li>	The days of absence will be treated as Loss of Pay.</li>
<li>	The employee has to report to his / her Vertical Leader on rejoining duty from absence and provide valid reasons for absence in writing before taking up work again.</li>
<li>If an employee is absent from duty continuously for more than 7 days (including any national / festival / declared / weekly off days which may fall in-between), an official correspondence from the HR team will be sent to him asking to report to duty and to provide explanation for his absence.</li>
<li>	Based on the enquiry any action deemed fit will/would be taken by the management.</li>
<li>	If there were no response from the employee within the stipulated time mentioned in official correspondence, it would be assumed that the employee has withdrawn his service from the company on his own accord and recorded accordingly.</li>
